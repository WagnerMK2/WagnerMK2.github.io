    <p> 
        here i plan on making a low profile ring light for my camera for macro photography
    <p>
    <p>
        i am goint to start with a 49-82mm filter adapter and use a custom board and hopefully compact battrys that mount behind the board. 
    </p>
    <p>
        so far i plan on using a step up adapter, and a halo ring light then 3d printing a control box with dimmer control, probably using 1 or two 18650 batterys or a 9v battery. 
    </p>
    <p>
        one circuit design goes as such... battery, 12vdc out buck converter, PWM led controller... led ring. this depends on if the led's need PWM to dim? probably
        </p>
        <p>
            another goes... battery, adjustable buck converter 8-14vdc out, led ring. this may not work right.
        </p>
    <p>
        i wouldnt ming making a custom board and using smd led's and making an integrated dimmer, on off switch. could have sworn i saw that on instructables. need to look.
