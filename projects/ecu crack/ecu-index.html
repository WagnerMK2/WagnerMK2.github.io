    <p>
        i plan on documenting late 90's and early 2000's toyota ecus to see if i can crack and reprogram them.
    </p>
    <p>
        i've started saving pictures and notes from people on forums that have considered the same path.
    </p>
    <p>
        i'll start html pages for each ecu type and try and make is searchable via the site.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>top level folder will be named by toyota part number</li>
        <li>inside top folder will be a notes file, maybe in html</li>
        <li>inside top folder, there needs to be photoes folder</li>
        <li>inside photoes folder, raw and stitched     master folders</li>
        <li>circuit diagrams folder, needed for pics and diagrams of circuitry</li>
        <li>inside curcuits folder, circuit analasys docs, and folders inside for each micro controller</li>
        <li>microcontroller folders will have, datasheets, data and findings on IC pin outs and an html file with references tothe photoes of the specific IC</li>
    </ul>
