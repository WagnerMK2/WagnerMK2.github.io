    <h1>robotics rover project</h1>
    <p>ideally i would like to have a rover robot that works on wheels or tracks and has a robotic arm on it. the robotic arm should have interchangeable hands that can do different taks</p>
    <p>the arm should have a camera that looks over the hand unit so that the user can aim and what not</p>
        <p>the unit should have a gimbal camera and possibly a stationsary forward camera on a switcher. fpv drone hardware should be good for this</p>
        <p>basic funtions can be handled by a generic 8-10 channel RC reciever</p>
        <p>googled around a bit and large rectangular aluminum would be a great base fram material, </p>
        <p>it seems that tracked is harder to aceive that wheeled units, wheeled units have far less compexity. the curiosity rover design is interesting</p>
    <ul>hand functions
        <li>hold a can of wasp spray and activate it</li>
        <li>activate an air horn</li>
        <li>unse 2 pronged pincer</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
