<p>
    this is a drone that is mainly focused on using height advantage 
    to conduct sdr, wireless routing and visual observation experements.
</p>
<p>
    the teathering on this drone should look like a generator running 
    the power box, or a vehicle running the power box. the power box has 
    a spool of 14-18 ga wire running at higher voltage that will allow 
    more watage at lower amps. the drone will carry an dc/dc converter or a 
    inverto to take AC on the teather and converter.
    the teather might also have a 4 strand of cat cable &lpar;to save weight&rpar; 
    for ethernet comms. the cable should have a braided sheath for abrasion 
    protection and just to keep the cable tiddy. 
    the spool sould hvae a cable guiding device on it. i think that ideally there 
    should be some tension kept on the cabe while the drone is in flight.

<p>
    there seems to be alot of available products for this project, i might be able to 
    just buy bulk cable, premade.
</p>
<p>
    one idea i have is to run the system out of a vehicle top box and 
    have the data piped into a control box in the vehicle. this could 
    have automated systems that keep the drone above the vehicle
