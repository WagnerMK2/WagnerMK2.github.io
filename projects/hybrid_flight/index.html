    <h1>ideas for a fixed wing hybrid drive drone propusion system</h1>
    <p>
        this is a collection of ideas for using a hybrid gas/electric system to drive a fixed wing UAV
    </p>

    <h2>broad strokes</h2>
    <p>
        ideally i would like to use a 4 stroke electric motor driving an electric motor with a one way sprag inbetween. 
        the electric motor would have a prop fixed at the end of it. when the gas motor runs, its drives the electric 
        motor and prop through the one way sprag. overrunning the sprag. ideally the electric motor would use a generator 
        mode to generate electricity for the battery bank onboard. when either out of gas or no longer wanting the gas 
        motor to run. the gas engine will shut off and the electric motor will run the prop by itself via the freshly charged 
        battery bank.

    <h2>electric motor</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        ideally the motor would be brushless in design, and possibly custom wound. a motor would to just be a 3ph electric 
        motor may not be ideally set up to be a generator. in this case the ability ro electrically change the witing type and 
        pole configuration may be disireable. 
        <br>
        this may lead to  6 or 12 wire motor configuration. the switcher would have to handle the full amperage of the motor.
        <br>
        <h3>typres of motor wire sitching</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>all solid state switching</li>
            <li>hybrid relay and solid state</li>
            <li>all relay based switching</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        this will have to be figured out based on switching time and load values. we should be able to vary the load on the 
        generator based on charging needs. but it should not stop charging while the gas motor is running. we may need to 
        figure out a shunting operation, heat the wings or something.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        this is where i talk about wye and delta motor configurations and how they lead to winding ratios and which is more 
        efficient for motoring and generating.
