    <p>this is a test page</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        what if this wasnt just a test page but i took the time to lay out 
        things i think people should know.  For instance, today i helped a 
        guy at work on some ethernet stuff. stuff that i think all of the techs 
        at my work should know. but thte company has not stepped up and tought
        us anything new since we journeyed out. i could set up a page that 
        guided a perspn if so inclined to learn for them selves. basic 
        ethernet cable diag.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        the greatest problem i have here is that most people i encounter only 
        want to have the small peice of info that they think want instead of 
        learning generally. this problem causes me great frusteration. because 
        it would seen that all these guys want is the fish and to completely 
        bypass learning how to fish.

            the fluke dsp-4000 user manual has a great section on basic ethernet cale diagnosis.

        the parts i find most useful are.

    <ul>
        <li>tdr test</li>
        <li>resistance test but live and static</li>
        <li>wire mapping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        the rest of the tests are not as useful in the current scope of troubleshooting here.
