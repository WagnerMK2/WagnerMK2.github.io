        <h2>history of my experiences learning to make brisket</h2>
            <p>
                this is a paragraph about when i cooked brisket in an oven. decribe process. high overview of how I evolved.
                im going to reference alot of other peoples work here. this is because im not breaking any new ground here. 
                but im just collecting everything i consider useful into one.
            </p>
            <p>
                when i started, i cooked a brisket in an electric  in my 1 bedroom appt, i used a roasting pan with a raised bed in it. i used a mustard slather and a generic rub with a bunch of brown sugar in it. i was very concerned about carmalizing the sugar in the rub almost to the point of ignoring the meat, i ended up getting impatient and using the roast function at the end expecting to carmelize but it created a very burnt bark. the meat ended up being very dry and just not all that great, i do not think that i rested the meat for long.
            </p>
            <p>
                i believe that my friend john from work convinced me to try again. i ended up buying a treager JR. at costco and eventually tried another brisket, 
            </p>
            <p>
                over the next several years i experemented and researched and have come up with this, the summation of my knowledge, esxperiences and resources on the topic of brisket cookin on a pellet GRILL!
            </p>

    <div class="box-2">
        <!--comment, this will be a larger intro to pellet grills, use maintainance, cleaning and mods-->
        <h2>the grill</h2>
        <p>
            a pellet grill at its core is a very basic device. it has a controller, draft fan, hopper, pellet delivery system, an optional hot rod fire starter, a burn box, heat sheilds, drip tray and the grill. the exhaust and lid are a given.
        </p>
        <p>
            the first treager grills did not use a hot rod starter system, the had a quick access hatch for you to torch start the fire pot with a handfull of pellets, while rare, this method can still work as a back up if your hot rod fails or shorts out and tripps the GFCI outlet.
        </p>
        <p>
            three types of controllers, fixed run time, internal temp reactive only, and the programmable dynamic type.
        </p>
        <p>
            the grill will accumulate ash in the bottom of the grill and the firepot will collect an amount of ash as well, you should periodically vacuum out the ash from grill. i have a dedicated small wet dry vac for the grill. DO OT under any circumstances vacuum a hot grill. i cought a grill filter on fire doing this when i had a grill fire go out. i recovered the cook but nearly lost the vacuum.
        </p>
        <p>
            always cover your drip tray with aluminum foil. it keeps butn grease from building up and making you fight to scrape it off. please use the heavy duty foil, you will be rewarded if you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            insulating your grill, there are a few ways to acomplish this. add fire bricks to the empty underside of the grill, use an approved insulation blanket kit, add a second layer of metal to the grill "i believe that treager does this on their timberline series of grills." ........expant this.....  conserves pellets, keeps winter out of the grill, watch out for corrosiaon. works like an electric capacitor, probably want to run extended warm up cycles
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>the grill controller, large increments, fine increments, time programmable, temp compensating</li>
            <li>drip tray and keep yo grill clean, talk about grill maintainance, cleaning the hopper and scrapping 
                soot, and leftover grease, talk about the grill fire of 2015.</li>
            <li>hot spots, talk about tracking hot spots on your grill, use bacon, hamburgers, etc on other cooks 
                to set a precedent. put the hut spots under the thickest part of the meat if possible</li>
            <li>pellet capacity, i have used as much as 23 lbs of pellets on a large brisket cook session. 
                smaller pellet hopper means frequent trips to the grill</li>
            <li>airflow vs temp VS climate grudge match Mr. aaron franklin cooks at 275all day, but im advocating 
                to lower temps. why, airflow for one, distance from the heat source is another. </li>
            <li>tracking your temp, wireless temp trackers, grill auto compensating probes, reliable tech 
                and non reliable tech, tracking grill temp and meat temp.</li>
            <li>caring for your grill in the long term, along with cleaning, check firepot condition, heat sheild condition, drip tray condition. maybe look into heavier duty parts. and mod the heat sheild with heavier metal, mass can be your friend</li>
            <li>talk about grill fires and low and slow burnouts and how they can cause "explosions"</li>
            <li>talk about pellet selection on the topic of quality</li>

            <dt>wet aging</dt>
                <dd>wet aging basicly means keeping it in the bag taht you purchased it in,
                    normally when the cow is butchured the brisket cut gets put immediatly 
                    in to the vacuum bag. this limits exposure to microbs.</dd>
                <dd>it is good practice to try to determine the packaging date when you purchase the meat. 
                    my experiecne has been that i can routinely buy 14-30 day aged meat at cash-n-carry. 
                    I have used 30-45 day aged meat with good results. the first time i tried to wet age a brisket, 
                    i aged the meat about 60 days. it was interesting, it was definatly tender, 
                    but it had a funny smell &#40not like rotten&#41,
                    i threw it away but upon further research that was normal and that cut would have cooked up great.
