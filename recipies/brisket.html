        <h2>history of my experiences learning to make brisket</h2>
            <p>
                this is a paragraph about when i cooked brisket in an oven. decribe process. high overview of how I evolved.
                im going to reference alot of other peoples work here. this is because im not breaking any new ground here. 
                but im just collecting everything i consider useful into one.

        <h2>the grill</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>the grill controller, large increments, fine increments, time programmable, temp compensating</li>
            <li>drip tray and keep yo grill clean, talk about grill maintainance, cleaning the hopper and scrapping 
                soot, and leftover grease, talk about the grill fire of 2015.</li>
            <li>hot spots, talk about tracking hot spots on your grill, use bacon, hamburgers, etc on other cooks 
                to set a precedent. put the hut spots under the thickest part of the meat if possible</li>
            <li>pellet capacity, i have used as much as 23 lbs of pellets on a large brisket cook session. 
                smaller pellet hopper means frequent trips to the grill</li>
            <li>airflow vs temp VS climate grudge match Mr. aaron franklin cooks at 275all day, but im advocating 
                to lower temps. why, airflow for one, distance from the heat source is another. </li>
            <li>tracking your temp, wireless temp trackers, grill auto compensating probes, reliable tech 
                and non reliable tech, tracking grill temp and meat temp.</li>
            <li>insulating your grill, probably a good idea. conserves pellets, keeps winter out of the grill, watch out for corrosiaon, etc</li>
            <li>heat sink bricks, arguments for and against, works like an electric capacitor, probably want to run extended warm up cycles</li>
            <li>conver your drip tray with foil please</li>
            <li>caring for your grill in the long term, along with cleaning, check firepot condition, heat sheild condition, drip tray condition.
                maybe look into heavier duty parts. and mod the heat sheild with heavier metal, mass can be your friend</li>
            <li>talk about grill fires and low and slow burnouts and how they can cause "explosions"</li>
                <li>talk about pellet selection on the topic of quality</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>to mail order or not to mail order, the comodity grade, better grade and custom artisian grass fed "this was the cows name", 
                cash and carry, snake river, costco, safeway, local butchery</li>
            <li>fat, fat cap,deckle, how bendy is the brisket</li>
            <li>size, thisckness, flat wtdth, sheer pundage, the difference between 8 lbs, 12lbs, 16lbs and 20 plus pounders</li>
            <li>marbeling and grades of meat, choice, select, prime, beyond prime</li>
            <li>assesing the flat</li>

            age is just a number

        <h3>diff types of aging</h3>

            <dt>wet aging</dt>
                <dd>wet aging basicly means keeping it in the bag taht you purchased it in,
                    normally when the cow is butchured the brisket cut gets put immediatly 
                    in to the vacuum bag. this limits exposure to microbs.</dd>
                <dd>it is good practice to try to determine the packaging date when you purchase the meat. 
                    my experiecne has been that i can routinely buy 14-30 day aged meat at cash-n-carry. 
                    I have used 30-45 day aged meat with good results. the first time i tried to wet age a brisket, 
                    i aged the meat about 60 days. it was interesting, it was definatly tender, 
                    but it had a funny smell &#40not like rotten&#41,
                    i threw it away but upon further research that was normal and that cut would have cooked up great.
